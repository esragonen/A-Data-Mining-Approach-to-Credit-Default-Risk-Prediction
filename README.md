# A-Data-Mining-Approach-to-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction

This project presents an end-to-end data mining framework developed to predict individual credit default risk using approximately 32,000 loan applications. The primary objective is to classify borrowers as either DEFAULT or NO DEFAULT based on demographic and financial attributes such as age, income, employment duration, loan amount, interest rate, loan grade, home ownership status, and credit history length. The study aims to build an interpretable and statistically robust model that can support early credit risk detection in financial institutions.
The project begins with a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing phase. Irrelevant variables such as customer ID were removed, incorrect data types were corrected, and logically inconsistent observations were eliminated. Missing values were handled based on their statistical mechanism. Variables identified as Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) were imputed using median imputation, while variables following a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism were handled using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation. For categorical variables with substantial missingness, missing values were treated as a separate “Unknown” category to prevent information loss. Additionally, log transformations were applied to skewed financial variables to stabilize variance and reduce the influence of extreme values. To prevent data leakage, the dataset was split into stratified train and test sets before modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distributional characteristics of the data and the relationships between variables. The dataset exhibited class imbalance, with approximately 79% non-default and 21% default observations. Correlation analysis showed no severe multicollinearity issues, although a strong natural relationship between age and credit history length was identified. Visualizations and statistical tests revealed that lower credit grades, higher loan amounts, and higher interest rates are associated with increased default risk, while higher income levels and home ownership status reduce default probability.
Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) was performed using formal hypothesis testing to validate patterns observed during EDA. Chi-square tests demonstrated statistically significant relationships between loan grade and default status, as well as between home ownership and default status. Since income and loan amount variables violated normality and homogeneity assumptions, Mann–Whitney U tests were used, confirming statistically significant differences between defaulted and non-defaulted customers. These results supported the inclusion of these variables in the modeling stage.
Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction were applied to improve model efficiency and interpretability. Categorical variables were encoded using dummy encoding (N−1 approach), and the ordinal structure of loan grade was preserved through ordinal encoding. To address redundancy between age and credit history length, a new feature representing the ratio of credit history length to age was created. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE were also explored for dimensionality reduction and visualization purposes. While PCA preserved variance structure, it was observed that dimensionality reduction did not improve classification performance, indicating that the problem requires preserving original feature information.
For modeling, Logistic Regression was selected as the primary classification method due to its interpretability and suitability for binary outcomes. Multiple approaches were systematically compared, including Baseline Logistic Regression, Cost-Sensitive Logistic Regression, SMOTE-based Logistic Regression, PCA-based models, and regularized models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net). Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation, and performance was assessed using metrics appropriate for imbalanced data, including ROC-AUC, F1-score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Cohen’s Kappa.
The results showed that Logistic Regression models achieved strong discriminative performance, with ROC-AUC values around 0.98. Although class-weighted and SMOTE approaches improved sensitivity for the minority class, they reduced overall model balance. The Ridge Logistic Regression model was selected as the final model due to its high and stable performance, coefficient stability, statistical significance, and strong generalizability. The final model identified lower credit grades, higher loan amounts, higher interest rates, and renting status as major risk-increasing factors, while home ownership, stable employment, and certain loan purposes were associated with lower default risk.
Overall, this project provides a statistically sound, interpretable, and practically applicable credit risk prediction framework. The developed approach can be directly utilized in credit scoring systems, early warning mechanisms, and risk management strategies within financial institutions. Future improvements may include incorporating time-series data or exploring non-linear machine learning models to further enhance predictive performance.
